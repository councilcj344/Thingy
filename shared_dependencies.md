It seems like there's a misunderstanding. To answer your original question, here are the shared dependencies for the files we are generating:

1. "minecraft_ai/main.py": This file will likely import the agent, environment, utils, and config files. It may also share a common logging setup with the other files.

2. "minecraft_ai/agent.py": This file will likely import the environment and utils files. It may also share a common logging setup with the other files.

3. "minecraft_ai/environment.py": This file will likely import the utils file. It may also share a common logging setup with the other files.

4. "minecraft_ai/utils.py": This file will likely be imported by all other files. It may also share a common logging setup with the other files.

5. "minecraft_ai/config.py": This file will likely be imported by all other files. It may also share a common logging setup with the other files.

Shared variables might include the game state, agent state, and configuration settings. Shared function names might include those for initializing the game, updating the game state, and controlling the agent. Shared message names might include those for logging game and agent events.

As for your second question, it's unclear what you mean by "Why is it cancelled". Could you please provide more context?
